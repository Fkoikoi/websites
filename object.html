<h2> This Land Is Your Land</h2>
<br>by woody Guthrie <br>
<br>This land is your land This land is my Land
<br>From California to the New York island;
<br>From the red wood forest to the Gulf stream waters
<br>This land was made for you and Me. <br>
<br>As I was walking that rabbon of highway,
<br>I saw above me that endless skyway:
<br>I saw below me that golden valley:
<br>This land was made for you and me.<br>
<br>I've roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps
<br>To the sparkling sands od her diamond deserts;
<br>And all around me a voice was sounding:
<br>This land was made for you and me.<br>
<br>When the sun came shining, and I was strolling,
<br>And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling,
<br>As the fog was lifting a voice was chanting:
<br>This land was made for you and me.<br>
<br>As I went walking I saw a sign There
<br>And on the sign it said <q>No Trespassing.</q>
<br>But on the other side it didn't say nothing,
<br>That side was made for you and me.<br>
<br>In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people,
<br>By the relief office I seem my people;
<br>As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking
<br>Is this land made for you and me?<br>
<br>Noboy living can ever stop me,
<br>As I go walking that freedom highway;
<br>Nobody living can ever make me turn back
<br>This land was made for you and me.
